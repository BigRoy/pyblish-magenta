#### Test-case: *The Deal*

On the official Pyblish forums we started developing a project as a test-case
for Pyblish Magenta, [more information here](http://forums.pyblish.com/t/pyblish-magenta/79).

The Deal is a *very short animated film*  developed in a community-driven way
where anyone is allowed to jump right in and start working on assets, shots and
the whole shebang.
